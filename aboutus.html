                          <br>
                          Even after independence we still find so many inequalities in our society. Many people came forward and many are still making incessant efforts to eradicate them in all possible ways. Even our government is implementing various schemes for the upliftment of economically and socially backward people. <br><br>


                          A number of charitable trusts, foundations, NGO's, Christian Missionaries etc. have been established to give their helping hand  for the service of  helpless people like orphans, mentally & physically challenged people and also aged people. Some of the above organizations are providing quality education for poor students at free of cost. Some other organizations are offering quality medical aid for the poor at free of cost. In this way a lot of people are doing their best for the wellbeing of the entire mankind without any selfish motives. <br><br>

                          <In the same manner, by the intuition of Samardha Sadguru, 
			  <br>Sri Sai Trust was established in the year 2015 with the intention of making an effort to establish a new society where people think that <b>“As all living beings are nothing but incarnation of the Almighty so every one must follow the principle that “Humanity  is true religion” and should not have any inequalities among them. </b> 
			  <br><br>  and with the motto of 
			  <br> <i>stretching a helping hand for the service of the helpless, the destitute, the shelterless and those who are deserved....</i> <br><br>
                          As Saibaba encouraged charity and said, "Unless there is some relationship or connection, nobody goes anywhere. If any men or creatures come to you, do not discourteously drive them away, but receive them well and treat them with due respect." <br><br>

                          It is solely an intensive motivation of Bhagavan Sri Samardha Sadguru Sainath Maharaj  that has lead to the establishment of the Trust. It was thought  long before as I got a call from Guru. But, I couldn't put my fullest effort towards it since I had been busy with my personal & professional commitments. Later, my health started degenerating so fast that I underwent a surgery resulting in removal of one of my lungs. I had to face the toughest time as it suddenly turned against me. Moreover, my financial crisis added fuel to the fire, throwing my family into a helpless state. But,  I continued  my steadfast and invincible  faith in my Guru despite the unfavorable circumstances. Later, my health has been stabilized to some extent by His grace and to my surprise, things started turning so favourable that the Trust was established within a short period of time.

                          We don't aspire for reputation and popularity and the same time we don't highlight anybody for publicity. We long to be recognised as "servants of sadguru sai" but not as an individual identity/recognition with our name, fame. Here, we are willing to take the co-operation and contribution of members and volunteers from all walks of life especially the  students & teaching community who obey and follow the motives of trust, which are the soul of our trust sincerely.
